<p>Lake George was frozen and the snow four feet deep in the woods, when on March 10, 1758,
Colonel Haviland, commanding at Fort Edward, sent Major Rogers with
one hundred and eighty men to reconnoitre the French position at Carillon, or Ticonderoga.</p>
<p>Rogers and his Rangers marched from Fort Edward in snow shoes to the half-way brook, in the road
leading to Lake George, and there encamped the first night.</p>
<p>On the 11th they proceeded as far as the First Narrows on Lake George and encamped that evening
on the east side of the lake.</p>
<p>At sunrise of the 12th they marched from their encampment. When they had gone some three miles,
the Major saw a dog running across the lake. Thinking that the Indians might be lying in ambush,
he sent a detachment to reconnoitre the island. None, however,
could be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
To prevent the enemy from discovering his force, Rogers halted at Sabbath-Day Point,
on the west side of the lake. From the hills he looked northward over the lake with his perspective glass,
but could see no signs of French or Indians. As soon as it was dark the party advanced down the lake.
Lieutenant Phillips and fifteen men, laying aside their snow shoes and putting on skates,
glided down the lake, as an advanced guard. The main body, flanked on the left by Ensign Ross,
marched under the west shore. It was a very dark night and the band of rugged foresters
kept close together to prevent separation. In this manner they continued their silent march
close to the mountains fringing the lake until within eight miles of the French advanced guards,
when they were informed by Lieutenant Phillips, who had hastened back, that a fire had been
discovered in the woods on the east shore.</p>
<p>The Rangers, after hiding their sleighs and packs in a thicket, marched to attack the enemy’s
encampment, but when they reached the place no fires were to be seen.
They did not know that the French had discovered their advanced guard and,
putting out their fire, had carried the intelligence to Ticonderoga.
The Rangers then returned to their packs and there lay the remainder of
the night without fire, so that no column of blue smoke would reveal their hiding place.</p>
<p>At sunrise of the 13th the Rangers left the lake and on snow shoes struck into the woods on
the west side, keeping on the back of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>mountains that overlooked the French advanced guards.</p>
<p>They halted at noon at a point nearly west of the mountain—that from that
day was to bear the name of Rogers—and some two miles from the French lines.
Little did they know what that tragic afternoon held in store for them.
Here they refreshed themselves until 3 o’clock, that the day scout
from the fort might return before they advanced, since the Major intended
at night to ambuscade some of the roads in order to trap the enemy in the morning.</p>
<p>Once more they began their toilsome march, one division headed by Major Rogers, the other
by Captain Buckley; a rivulet at a small distance was on their left,
and a steep mountain on their right. They kept well to the mountain, for the Major thought that
the enemy would travel on the ice of the rivulet since it was very bad travelling on snow shoes.
When they had gone a mile and a half a scout from the front told Rogers that the enemy was approaching on
the bed of the frozen stream,—ninety-six of them—chiefly savages.
The Rangers, concealed by the bank of the rivulet, immediately laid an ambush,
gave the first fire and killed above forty Indians whom they scalped on the spot.
The rest retreated, followed by about one-half of the Rangers, who were exulting
over their victory, only to be suddenly confronted by more than six hundred Canadians
and Indians fresh from Fort Ticonderoga, under Durantaye and De Langry, French officers
of reputation, who were fully prepared to meet four hundred Rangers,
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> whose movements they had been
apprized both by the prisoner taken and by the deserter from Putnam’s men. Rogers
ordered a retreat, which he gained at the expense of fifty men killed;
the remainder he rallied and drew up in good order. They fought with such intrepidity
and bravery that they obliged the enemy “tho seven to one in number,” to retreat
a second time, but Rogers had not sufficient numbers to follow up the advantage.
The enemy then rallied and, recovering their ground, fought with great tenacity
and determination, but were so warmly received that they were put to rout the third time.
Finding the Rogers party so much inferior to themselves in number, the enemy
again rallied and renewed the fight with vigor for some time. A body of two hundred
Indians were now discovered going up the mountain on the right in order to gain the
rear of the Rangers. Lieutenant Phillips with eighteen men gained the first possession
and beat them back. Lieutenant Crafton with fifteen men stopped the French
on the left from gaining the other part of the mountain. Two gentlemen volunteers
hastened up and supported him with great bravery. The enemy now pushed so closely
on the front that the combatants were often not twenty yards apart, and sometimes
were mixed together. Lieutenant Phillips, surrounded by three hundred Indians,
surrendered under promise of good quarter, but a few minutes later he and his
whole party were tied to trees and hacked to death in a most barbarous manner.
The savages maddened, it is said, by the sight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of a scalp they found in the breast of a man’s hunting frock, revenged themselves
on their victims by holding up their scalps. The Rangers were now broken and put to
flight, each man for himself, while the Indians, closely pursuing, took several prisoners.</p>

<div class="caption">ROGERS’ ROCK</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>My great-great-grandfather in his modest narrative does not mention his own
hairbreadth escape. The Rangers, when put to flight, retreated in the best manner
possible. Rogers was singled out by the French; the Indians, closely pursuing,
ran him up the steep mountain then known as Bald Mountain, since Rogers Rock,
to its face, and there on the brow of the precipice he threw away his knapsack
and clothes together with his commission. There was but one chance for his life,
and death was preferable to capture and torture by the savages.</p>
<p>Slowly the sun is setting over the mountain tops, gilding the lake below,
as down the face of the precipitous rock for more than a thousand feet he slides
in his snow shoes to the frozen lake below, and there, quickly changing his snow
shoes for skates, glides over the vast white desert. Scarcely had he disappeared
from sight when the foremost warrior reached the cliff sure of his prey—“No Roger!”
There were his tracks! Other warriors came running up to the cliff sure of
the prize—Rogers’ scalp—for the enemy dreaded him, and with reason—and gazed upon his tracks.</p>
<p>Soon a rapidly receding form on the ice below attracted their notice, and
the baffled savages, seeing that the famous Ranger had safely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>effected the perilous descent,
gave up the chase fully persuaded that Rogers was under the protection of the
Great Spirit. The Indians have a superstition, that the witches or evil spirits
haunt this place, and seizing upon the spirits of bad Indians, on their way
to the happy hunting grounds, slide down the precipitous cliff with them into
the lake where they are drowned. Atalapose is their word for a sliding place.</p>
<p>During the one and one-half hours of battle the Rangers lost eight officers
and more than
one hundred privates killed on the spot. The enemy lost one hundred and fifty killed and some
one hundred and fifty wounded, mostly Indians.</p>
<p>Was Colonel Haviland so indifferent and shortsighted as to send Robert Rogers with his brave
Rangers to meet this impossible situation at such a great loss of life, or was he influenced by
improper motives? Evidently Rogers’s suspicions were awakened, for the clause, “but my commander
doubtless had his reasons, and is able to vindicate his own conduct,” is italicized in his journal.</p>
<p>This is what Major General John Stark, the friend and companion of Rogers says, though not in
the engagement, of Colonel Haviland’s act: “This officer was the same who sent him (Rogers) out
in March, 1758, with a small force, when he knew a superior one lay in wait for him. He was one
of those sort of men who manage to escape public censure, let them do what they will. He ought
to have been cashiered for his conduct on that occasion. He was one of the many British officers
 who were meanly jealous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> of the daring
achievements of their brave American comrades, but for whose intrepidity and arduous services,
all the British armies, sent to America during the seven years’ war would have effected little
toward the conquest of Canada.”—Memoir of Gen. John Stark, page 454.</p>
<p>Rogers was saved by a miracle and by his own daring. Thus ended his brave but unfortunate
battle on snow shoes.</p>
<p>General Montcalm in a letter dated less than a month after the encounter, says:
“Our Indians would give no quarter; they have brought back one hundred and forty-six scalps.”</p>
<p>We can not with certainty say what Rogers, at this time twenty-six years of age,
might have done had he had four hundred strong—but there is every probability that
he would have put the enemy to rout.</p>
<p>When I visited this beautiful and romantic region, where one hundred and fifty
years ago, and something more, the famous action took place, my mind passed in
swift review through that notable afternoon when the Rangers fought one of their
most desperate and unequal battles in the “Old French and Indian War.”</p>
<p>In fancy I saw this picturesque body of Rangers, clad in skin and gray duffle
hunting frocks; each man well armed with firelock, hatchet, and scalping knife,
a bullock’s horn full of powder hanging under his right arm by a belt from the
left shoulder, and a leathern or seal skin bag, buckled around his waist,
hanging down in front full of bullets and smaller shot, the size of full grown peas,
and in the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
my great-great-grandfather’s powder horn a small compass, while the French officers
were clad in bright uniforms and the Indians in true Indian fashion gaily decorated with war paint.</p>
<p>I seemed to hear this peaceful solitude made hideous with the yells of the savages.</p>
<p>Behind this bank the Rangers lay in ambush for the Indians and killed and scalped
about forty of them. Here they were confronted by more than six hundred Canadians
and Indians well versed in forest warfare.</p>
<p>In this place the Rangers fought, “seven to one,” from behind forest trees,
for this theatre of action retains much of its original character preserved,
improved and owned by Mr. David Williams. The Rogers Rock property includes
the Slide and extends for more than a mile and a half along the shore of
Lake George and some half of a mile back of Rogers Rock.</p>
<p>For more than an hour and a half this unequal contest raged. The Rangers
after a long toilsome march on snow shoes and having camped three nights,
sleeping in hammocks of spruce boughs, the third and last night without
fire and chilled—the French and Indians fresh from the Fort.</p>
<p>The brave Rangers were fast falling everywhere, and the snow is crimsoned
with their blood. They were the most hardy and resolute young men New Hampshire
and other Colonies could produce, and their descendants are now filling their
places in the world’s niches well to-day.</p>
<p>Here is the trail Rogers followed up the steep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mountain to the brow of the cliff, and there is the rock down which he made his
miraculous escape. As the vision passes one cannot help saying,
“ALL HONOR TO THOSE BRAVE MEN WHO HERE FELL MARCH 13, 1758.”</p>
<p>An anecdote which my grandfather used to tell deserves to be mentioned.
While Major Rogers was in garrison at Fort Edward in the winter of 1757-8,
two British officers, half seas over, were one evening bemoaning their country’s
enormous debt. Rogers, coming in, and hearing the patriotic bewailing, cried:
“Give yourselves no more uneasiness about the matter, gentlemen, I will pay
half of the debt and a friend of mine the remainder. We will clear the nation
at once of her difficulties.”</p>
<p>The officers treated the Major and pronounced him the nation’s benefactor.
Hence the saying: “To pay one’s debts as Rogers did that of the nation.”</p>
<p>A Gentleman of the army, who was a volunteer on this party, and who with
another fell into the hands of the French, wrote the following letter,
some time after, to the officer commanding the regiment they belonged to at Fort Edward.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sign">Carillon, March 28, 1758.</p>
<p>“Dear Sir,<br/></p>
<p>“As a flag of truce is daily expected here with an answer to Monsieur Vaudreuil, I sit down to write the moment I am able, in order to have a letter ready, as no doubt you and our friends at Fort Edward are anxious to be informed about Mr. —— and me, whom probably you have reckoned amongst the slain in our unfortunate rencontre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> of the 13th, concerning which at present I shall not be particular; only to do this justice to those who lost their lives there, and to those who have escaped, to assure you, Sir, that such dispositions were formed by the enemy (who discovered us long before), it was impossible for a party so weak as ours to hope for even a retreat. Towards the conclusion of the affair, it was cried from a rising ground on our right, to retire there; where, after scrambling with difficulty, as I was unaccustomed to snow-shoes, I found Capt. Rogers, and told him that I saw to retire further was impossible, therefore earnestly begged we might collect all the men left, and make a stand there. Mr. ——, who was with him, was of my opinion, and Capt. Rogers also; who therefore desired me to maintain one side of the hill, whilst he defended the other. Our parties did not exceed above ten or twelve in each, and mine was shifting towards the mountain, leaving me unable to defend my post, or to labour with them up the hill. In the meantime, Capt. Rogers with his party came to me, and said (as did those with him) that a large body of Indians had ascended to our right; he likewise added, what was true, that the combat was very unequal, that I must retire, and he would give Mr. —— and me a Serjeant to conduct us thro’ the mountain. No doubt prudence required us to accept his offer; but, besides one of my snow-shoes being untied, I knew myself unable to march as fast as was requisite to avoid becoming a sacrifice to an enemy we could no longer oppose; I therefore begged of him to proceed, and then leaned against a rock in the path, determined to submit to a fate I thought unavoidable. Unfortunately for Mr. —— his snow-shoes were loosened likewise, which obliged him to determine with me, not to labour in a flight we were both unequal to. Every instant we expected the savages; but what induced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> them to quit this path, in which we actually saw them, we are ignorant of, unless they changed it for a shorter, to intercept those who had just left us. By their noise, and making a fire, we imagined they had got the rum in the Rangers’ packs. This thought, with the approach of night, gave us the first hopes of retiring; and when the moon arose, we marched to the southward along the mountains about three hours, which brought us to ice, and gave us reason to hope our difficulties were almost past; but we knew not we had enemies yet to combat with, more cruel than the savages we had escaped. We marched all night, and on the morning of the 14th found ourselves entirely unacquainted with the ice. Here we saw a man, who came towards us; he was the servant of Capt. Rogers, with whom he had been often times all over the country, and, without the least hesitation whatsoever, he informed us we were upon South-Bay; that Wood-Creek was just before us; that he knew the way to Fort Anne extremely well, and would take us to Fort Edward the next day. Notwithstanding we were disappointed in our hopes of being upon Lake George, we thought ourselves fortunate in meeting such a guide, to whom we gave entire confidence, and which he in fact confirmed, by bringing us to a creek, where he shewed the tracks of Indians, and the path he said they had taken to Fort Anne. After struggling thro’ the snow some hours, we were obliged to halt to make snow-shoes, as Mr. —— and the guide had left theirs at arriving upon the ice. Here we remained all night, without any blankets, no coat, and but a single waistcoat each, for I gave one of mine to Mr. ——, who had laid aside his green jacket in the field, as I did likewise my furred cap, which became a mark to the enemy, and probably was the cause of a slight wound in my face; so that I had but a silk handkerchief on my head,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> and our fire could not be large, as we had nothing to cut wood with. Before morning we contrived, with forked sticks and strings of leather, a sort of snow-shoes, to prevent sinking entirely; and, on the 15th, followed our guide west all day, but he did not fulfil his promise; however the next day it was impossible to fail: but even then, the 16th, he was unsuccessful; yet still we were patient, because he seemed well acquainted with the way, for he gave every mountain a name, and shewed us several places, where he said his master had either killed deer or encamped. The ground, or rather the want of sunshine, made us incline to the southward, from whence by accident we saw ice, at several miles distance, to the south-east. I was very certain, that, after marching two days west of South Bay, Lake George could not lie south-east from us, and therefore concluded this to be the upper end of the bay we had left. For this reason, together with the assurances of our guide, I advised continuing our course to the west, which must shortly strike Fort Anne, or some other place that we knew. But Mr. —— wished to be upon ice at any rate; he was unable to continue in the snow, for the difficulties of our march had overcome him. And really, Sir, was I to be minute in those we had experienced already and afterwards, they would almost be as tiresome to you to read, as they were to us to suffer.</p>

MRS. ROBERT ROGERS (Elizabeth Browne)
<p>Photograph of the portrait of Mrs. Robert Rogers, in her bridal gown,
painted by Blackburn in 1761. She was married to Major Robert Rogers, by
her father, the Rev. Arthur Browne, Rector of Queen’s Chapel, in Portsmouth,
N. H., June 30, 1761, at the age of twenty years</p>

<p>“Our snow-shoes breaking, and sinking to our middle every fifty paces, the scrambling up mountains, and across fallen timber, our nights without sleep or covering, and but little fire, gathered with great fatigue, our sustenance mostly water, and the bark and berries of trees; for all our provisions from the beginning was only a small Bologna sausage, and a little ginger, I happened to have, and which even now was very much decreased; so that I knew not how to oppose Mr. ——’s intreaties; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> as our guide still persisted Fort Anne was near, we concluded to search a little longer, and if we made no discovery to proceed next day towards the ice; but we sought in vain, as did our guide the next morning, tho’ he returned, confidently asserting he had discoverd fresh proofs, that the fort could not be far off. I confess I was still inclined to follow him, for I was almost certain the best we could hope from descending upon this ice to our left, was to throw ourselves into the hands of the French, and perhaps not be able to effect even that; but, from the circumstances I have mentioned, it was a point I must yield to, which I did with great reluctancy. The whole day of the 17th we marched a dreadful road, between the mountains, with but one good snow-shoe each, the other of our own making being almost useless. The 18th brought us to the ice, which tho’ we longed to arrive at, yet I still dreaded the consequence, and with reason, for the first sight informed us, it was the very place we had left five days before. Here I must own my resolution almost failed me; when fatigue, cold, hunger, and even the prospect of perishing in the woods attended us, I still had hopes, and still gave encouragement, but now I wanted it myself; we had no resource but to throw ourselves into the enemy’s hands, or perish. We had nothing to eat, our slender stock had been equally shared amongst us three, and we were not so fortunate as even to see either bird or beast to shoot at. When our first thoughts were a little calmed, we conceived hopes, that, if we appeared before the French fort, with a white flag, the commanding officer would relieve and return us to Fort Edward. This served to palliate our nearest approach to despair, and determined a resolution, where, in fact, we had no choice. I knew Carillon had an extensive view up South Bay, therefore we concluded to halt during the evening, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> march in the night, that we might approach it in the morning, besides the wind pierced us like a sword; but instead of its abating it increased, together with a freezing rain, that incrusted us entirely with ice, and obliged us to remain until morning, the 19th, when we fortunately got some juniper berries, which revived, gave us spirits, and I thought strength. We were both so firmly of that opinion, that we proposed taking the advantage of its being a dark snowy day, to approach Carillon, to pass it in the night, and get upon Lake George. With difficulty we persuaded the guide to be of our opinion, we promised large rewards in vain, until I assured him of provisions hid upon the lake; but we little considered how much nature was exhausted, and how unequal we were to the task; however, a few miles convinced us; we were soon midway up our legs in the newfallen snow; it drove full in our faces, and was as dark as the fogs upon the banks of Newfoundland. Our strength and our hopes sunk together, nay, even those of reaching Carillon were doubtful, but we must proceed or perish. As it cleared up a little, we laboured to see the fort, which at every turn we expected, until we came to where the ice was gone, and the water narrow. This did not agree with my idea of South Bay, but it was no time for reflection; we quitted the ice to the left, and after marching two miles, our guide assured us we ought to be on the other side of the water. This was a very distressing circumstance, yet we returned to the ice and passed to the right, where, after struggling through the snow, about four miles, and breaking in every second step, as we had no snow-shoes, we were stopped by a large water-fall. Here I was again astonished with appearances, but nothing now was to be thought of only reaching the fort before night; yet to pass this place seemed impracticable; however, I attempted to ford it a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> little higher, and had almost gained the opposite shore, where the depth of the water, which was up to my breast and the rapidity of the stream, hurried me off the slippery rocks, and plunged me entirely in the waters. I was obliged to quit my fuzee, and with great difficulty escaped being carried down the fall. Mr. ——, who followed me, and the guide, though they held by one another, suffered the same fate; but the hopes of soon reaching a fire made us think lightly of this: as night approached, we laboured excessively through the snow; we were certain the fort was not far from us, but our guide confessed, for the first time, that he was at a loss. Here we plainly observed that his brain was affected: he saw Indians all around him, and though we have since learned we had every thing to fear from them, yet it was a danger we did not now attend to; nay, we shouted aloud several times to give information we were there; but we could neither hear nor see any body to lead us right, or more likely to destroy us, and if we halted a minute we became pillars of ice; so that we resolved, as it froze so hard, to make a fire, although the danger was apparent. Accidentally we had one dry cartridge, and in trying with my pistol if it would flash a little of the powder, Mr. —— unfortunately held the cartridge too near, by which it took fire, blew up in our faces, almost blinded him, and gave excessive pain. This indeed promised to be the last stroke of fortune, as our hopes of a fire were now no more; but although we were not anxious about life, we knew it was more becoming to oppose than yield to this last misfortune. We made a path round a tree, and there exercised all the night, though scarcely able to stand, or prevent each other from sleeping. Our guide, notwithstanding repeated cautions, straggled from us, where he sat down and died immediately. On the morning of the 20th, we saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> the fort, which we approached with a white flag: the officers run violently towards us, and saved us from a danger we did not then apprehend; for we are informed, that if the Indians, who were close after them, had seized us first, it would not have been in the power of the French to have prevented our being hurried to their camp, and perhaps to Montreal the next day, or killed for not being able to march. Mons. Debecourt<a id="FNanchor_1_1"/><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor pginternal">[1]</a> and all his officers treat us with humanity and politeness, and are solicitous in our recovery, which returns slowly, as you may imagine, from all these difficulties; and though I have omitted many, yet I am afraid you will think me too prolix; but we wish, Sir, to persuade you of a truth, that nothing but the situation I have faithfully described could determine us in a resolution which appeared only one degree preferable to perishing in the woods.</p>
<p>“I shall make no comments upon these distresses; the malicious
perhaps will say, which is very true, we brought them upon ourselves;
but let them not wantonly add, we deserved them because we were
unsuccessful. They must allow we could not be led abroad, at such
a season of snow and ice, for amusement, or by an idle curiosity.
I gave you, Sir, my reasons for asking leave, which you were pleased
to approve, and I hope will defend them; and the fame would make me
again, as a volunteer, experience the chance of war to-morrow,
had I an opportunity. These are Mr. ——’s sentiments as well as mine;
and we both know you, Sir, too well, to harbour the least doubt of
receiving justice with regard to our conduct in this affair, or our
promotion in the regiment; the prospect of not joining that so soon
as we flattered ourselves has depressed our spirits to the lowest
degree, so that we earnestly beg you will be solicitous with the
General to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> us
restored as soon as possible, or at least to prevent our being sent
to France, and separated from you, perhaps, during the war.</p>
<p>“I have but one thing more to add, which we learned here, and
which perhaps you have already observed from what I have said, that
we were upon no other ice than that of Lake George; but by the day
overtaking us, the morning of the 14th, in the very place we had,
in coming, marched during the night, we were entirely unacquainted
with it, and obliged to put a confidence in this guide, whose head
must have been astray from the beginning, or he could not so grossly
have mistaken a place where he had so often been. This information
but added to our distress, until we reflected that our not being entirely
lost was the more wonderful. That we had parted from South Bay on
the 14th, was a point with us beyond all doubt, and about which we
never once hesitated, so that we acted entirely contrary to what we
had established as a truth; for if, according to that, we had continued
our course to the west, we must inevitably have perished; but the hand
of Providence led us back contrary to our judgment; and though even
then, and often afterwards, we thought it severe, yet in the end
it saved us, and obliged us to rest satisfied that we construed
many things unfortunate, which tended to our preservation. I am, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class="pn center">EXTRACTS FROM THE JOURNAL OF MAJOR<br/>
ROBERT ROGERS (Dublin), 1769, pages 69-81.</p>
<p>“By his Excellency John Earl of Loudoun, Lord Machline and Tairenseen,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., one of the sixteen peers of Scotland, Governor
and Captain General of Virginia, and Vice Admiral of the same, Colonel
of the 13th Regiment of foot, Colonel in chief of the Royal American
regiment, Major General and Commander in Chief of all his Majesty’s
forces, raised or to be raised in North-America:</p>
<p>“Whereas I have this day thought proper to augment the Rangers
with five additional companies, that is, four New England and one
Indian company, to be forthwith raised and employed in his Majesty’s
service; and whereas I have an entire confidence in your skill and
knowledge, of the men most fit for that service; I do therefore by
these presents appoint you to raise such a number of non-commission
officers and private men as will be necessary to compleat the said
five companies, upon the following establishment, viz. each company
to consist of one Captain, two Lieutenants, one Ensign, four Serjeants
and 100 privates. The officers to have British pay, that is, the same
as an officer of the like rank in his Majesty’s regular forces; the
Serjeants 4s. New York currency per day, and the private men 2s. 6d
currency per day. And the better to enable you to make this levy of men,
you shall have one month’s pay for each of the said five companies
advanced to you; upon these conditions, that, out of the first warrants
that shall hereafter be granted for the subsistence of these companies,
shall be deducted the said month’s pay now advanced. Your men to find
their own arms, which must be such as upon examination, shall be found
fit, and be approved of. They are likewise to provide themselves with
good warm cloathing, which must be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>uniform in every
company, and likewise with good warm blankets. And the company of Indians
to be dressed in all respects in the true Indian fashion, and they are
all to be subject to the rules and articles of war. You will forthwith
acquaint the officers appointed to these companies, that they are
immediately to set out on the recruiting service, and you will not
fail to instruct them that they are not to inlist any man for a less
term than one year, nor any but what are able-bodied, well acquainted
with the woods, used to hunting, and every way qualified for the Ranging
service. You are also to observe that the number of men requisite to
compleat the said five companies, are all to be at Fort Edward on or
before the 15th day of March next ensuing, and those that shall come
by way of Albany are to be mustered there by the officer commanding,
as shall those who go strait to Fort Edward by the officer commanding
there. Given under my hand, at New York, the 11th day of January, 1758.</p>
<p class="pn">By his Excellency’s command,<span class="c6">Loudoun.</span></p>
<p>To Capt<br/>
Robert Rogers. <span class="c7">J. Appy.”</span></p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>In pursuance of the above instructions I immediately sent officers into
the New England provinces, where, by the assistance of my friends, the
requested augmentation of Rangers was quickly compleated, the whole five
companies being ready for service by the 4th of March.</p>
<p>Four of these companies were sent to Louisburg to join General Amherst,
and one joined the corps under my command; and tho’ I was at the whole
expence of raising the five companies, I never got the least allowance
for it, and one of the captains dying, to whom I had delivered a
thousand dollars as advance pay for his company, which, agreeable
to the instructions I received, had a right to do;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
yet was I obliged to account with the government for this money, and
entirely lost every penny of it. It has already been mentioned, that
the garrison at Fort Edward, was this winter under the command of Lieut. Col. Haviland.
This gentleman, about the 28th of February, ordered out a scout under the direction
of one Putnam, Captain of a company of one of the Connecticut provincial regiments,
with some of my men, given out publickly at the same time, that, upon Putnam’s return,
I should be sent to the French forts with a strong party of 400 Rangers.</p>
<p>This was known not only to all the officers, but soldiers also, at
Fort Edward before Putnam’s departure.</p>
<p>While this party was out, a servant of Mr. Best, a sutler to the Rangers,
was captivated by a flying party of the enemy from Ticonderoga; unfortunately
too, one of Putnam’s men had left him at Lake George, and deserted to the enemy.
Upon Captain Putnam’s return, we were informed he had ventured within eight miles
of the French fort at Ticonderoga, and that a party he had sent to make discoveries
had reported to him, that there were near 600 Indians not far from the enemy’s quarters.</p>
<p>March 10, 1758. Soon after the said Captain Putnam’s return, in consequence
of positive orders from Col. Haviland, I this day began a march from Fort
Edward for the neighbourhood of Carillon, not with a party of 400 men, as
at first given out, but of 180 men only, officers included, one Captain,
one Lieutenant, and one Ensign, and three volunteers, viz. Mess. Creed,
Kent and Wrightson, one serjeant, and one private, all of the 27th regiment;
and a detachment from the four companies of Rangers, quartered on the island
near Fort Edward, viz. Capt. Buckley, Lieutenants Philips, Moore, Crafton,
Campbell, and Pottinger; Ensigns Ross, Wait, M’Donald, and White, and 162
private men. I acknowledge I entered upon this service,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and viewed this small detachment of brave men march out, with no little concern
and uneasiness of mind; for, as there was the greatest reason to suspect,
that the French were, by the prisoner and deserter above mentioned, fully
informed of the design of sending me out upon Putnam’s return: what could
I think to see my party, instead of being strengthened and augmented,
reduced to less than one half the number at first proposed? I must confess
it appeared to me (ignorant and unskilled as I then was in
politicks and the art of war) incomprehensible; <i>but my commander
doubtless had his reasons, and is able to vindicate his own conduct</i>.
We marched to the half-way brook, in the road leading to Lake George,
and there encamped the first night.</p>
<p>The 11th we proceeded as far as the first Narrows on Lake George,
and encamped that evening on the east-side of the lake; and after dark,
I sent a party three miles further down, to see if the enemy might be
coming towards our forts, but they returned without discovering any. We
were, however, on our guard, and kept parties walking on the lake all
night, besides centries at all necessary places on the land.</p>
<p>The 12th we marched from our encampment at sunrise, and having
distanced it about three miles, I saw a dog running across the lake,
whereupon I sent a detachment to reconnoitre the island, thinking the
Indians might have laid in ambush there for us; but no such could be
discovered; upon which I thought it expedient to put to shore and lay
by till night, to prevent any party from descrying us on the lake, from
hills, or otherwise. We halted at a place called Sabbath-day Point,
on the west-side of the lake, and sent our parties to look down the
lake with perspective glasses, which we had for that purpose. As soon
as it was dark we proceeded down the lake. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sent Lieutenant Phillips with fifteen
men, as an advanced guard, some of whom went before him on scates,
while Ensign Ross flanked us on the left under the west-shore, near
which we kept the main body, marching as close as possible, to prevent
separation, it being a very dark night. In this manner we continued
our march till within eight miles of the French advanced guards, when
Lieutenant Phillips sent a man on scates back to me, to desire me to
halt; upon which I ordered my men to squat down upon the ice. Mr.
Phillips soon came to me himself, leaving his party to look out, and
said, he imagined he had discovered a fire<a id="FNanchor_2_2"/><a
href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor pginternal">[2]</a> on the
east-shore, but was not certain; upon which I sent with him Ensign
White, to make further discovery. In about an hour they returned,
fully persuaded that a party of the enemy was encamped there. I then
called in the advanced guard, and flanking party, and marched on to the
west-shore, where, in a thicket, we hid our sleys and packs, leaving a
small guard with them, and with the remainder I marched to attack the
enemy’s encampment, if there was any; but when we came near the place,
no fires were to be seen, which made us conclude that we had mistaken
some bleach patches of snow, or pieces of rotten wood, for fire (which
in the night, at a distances resembles it) whereupon we returned to our
packs, and there lay the remainder of the night without fire.</p>
<p>The 13th, in the morning, I deliberated with the officers how to
proceed, who were unanimously of opinion, that it was best to go by
land in snow-shoes, lest the enemy should discover us on the lake; we
accordingly continued our march on the west-side, keeping on the back
of the mountains that overlooked the French advanced guards. At twelve
of the clock we halted two miles west of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
guards, and there refreshed ourselves till
three, that the day-scout from the fort might be returned home before
we advanced; intending at night to ambuscade some of their roads, in
order to trepan them in the morning. We then marched in two divisions,
the one headed by Captain Buckley, the other by myself: Ensigns White
and Wait had the rear-guard, the other officers were posted properly in
each division, having a rivulet at a small distance on our left, and a
steep mountain on our right. We kept close to the mountain, that the
advanced guard might better observe the rivulet, on the ice of which I
imagined they would travel it out, as the snow was four feet deep, and
very bad traveling on snow-shoes.</p>
<p>In this manner we marched a mile and an half, when our advanced
guard informed me of the enemy being in their view; and soon after,
that they had ascertained their number to be ninety-six, chiefly
Indians.</p>
<p>We immediately laid down our packs, and prepared for battle,
supposing these to be the whole number or main body of the enemy, who
were marching on our left up the rivulet, upon the ice. I ordered
Ensign M’Donald to the command of the advanced guard, which, as we
faced to the left made a flanking party to our right. We marched to
within a few yards of the bank, which was higher than the ground we
occupied; and observing the ground gradually to descend from the bank
of the rivulet to the foot of the mountain, we extended our party along
the bank, far enough to command the whole of the enemy’s at once; we
waited till their front was nearly opposite to our left wing, when I
fired a gun, as a signal for a general discharge upon them, whereupon
we gave them the first fire, which killed above forty Indians; the
rest retreated, and were pursued by about one half of our people.
I now imagined the enemy totally defeated, and ordered Ensign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
M’Donald to head the
flying remains of them, that none might escape; but we soon found our
mistake, and that the party we had attacked were only their advanced
guard, their main body coming up, consisting of 600 more, Canadians
and Indians; upon which I ordered our people to retreat to their
own ground, which we gained at the expence of fifty men killed; the
remainder I rallied, and drew up in pretty good order, where they
fought with such intrepidity and bravery as obliged the enemy (tho’
seven to one in number) to retreat a second time; but we, not being
in a condition to pursue them, they rallied again, and recovered
their ground, and warmly pushed us in front and both wings, while
the mountain defended our rear; but they were so warmly received,
that their flanking parties soon retreated to their main body with
considerable loss. This threw the whole again into disorder, and they
retreated a third time; but our number being now too far reduced to
take advantage of their disorder, they rallied again, and made a fresh
attack upon us. About this time we discovered 200 Indians going up
the mountain on our right, as we supposed, to get possession of the
rising ground, and attack our rear; to prevent which I sent Lieutenant
Phillips, with eighteen men, to gain the first possession, and beat
them back; which he did, and being suspicious that the enemy would go
round on our left, and take possession of the other part of the hill, I
sent Lieutenant Crafton, with fifteen men, to prevent them there; and
soon after desired two Gentlemen, who were there, volunteers in the
party,<a id="FNanchor_3_3"/><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor pginternal">[3]</a> with a few men,
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> go and support him, which they did with
great bravery.</p>
<p>The enemy pushed us so close in front, that the parties were not
more than twenty yards asunder in general, and sometimes intermixed
with each other. The fire continued almost constant for an hour
and a half from the beginning of the attack, in which time we lost
eight officers, and more than 100 private men killed on the spot. We
were at last obliged to break, and I with about twenty men ran up
the hill to Phillips and Crafton, where we stopped and fired on the
Indians who were eagerly pushing us, with numbers that we could not
withstand. Lieutenant Phillips being surrounded by 300 Indians, was
at this time capitulating for himself and party, on the other part of
the hill. He spoke to me, and said if the enemy would give them good
quarters, he thought it best to surrender, otherwise that he would
fight while he had one man left to fire a gun.<a id="FNanchor_4_4"/><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor pginternal">[4]</a></p>
<p>I now thought it most prudent to retreat, and bring off with
me as many of my party as I possibly could, which I immediately
did; the Indians, closely pursuing us at the same time, took
several prisoners. We came to Lake George in the evening,
where we found several wounded men, whom we took with us
to the place where we had left our sleds, from whence I
sent an express to Fort Edward, desiring Mr. Haviland to
send a party to meet us, and assist us in bringing in the
wounded; with the remainder I tarried there the whole night,
without fire or blankets, and in the morning we proceeded up
the lake, and met with Captain Stark at Hoop Island, six
miles north from Fort William-Henry, and encamped there
that night; the next day being the 15th, in the evening, we arrived at Fort Edward.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
The number of the enemy was about 700, 600 of which were Indians.
By the best accounts we could get, we killed 150 of them, and wounded
as many more. I will not pretend to determine what we should have done
had we been 400 or more strong; but this I am obliged to say of those
brave men who attended me (most of whom are now no more) both officers
and soldiers in their respective stations behaved with uncommon resolution
and courage; nor do I know an instance during the whole action in which I
can justly impeach the prudence or good conduct of any one of them.</p>
<p class="pn center">The following is a LIST of the Killed, Missing, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Captain and Lieutenant of His Majesty’s regular troops,
volunteers in this party, were taken prisoners; the Ensign,
another volunteer of the same corps, was killed, as were two
volunteers, and a Serjeant of the said corps, and one private.</p>

<p class="pn center">MUSTER ROLL OF<br/>
CAPTAIN CHARLES BULKELEY’S COMPANY OF<br/>
RANGERS</p>
<p>The author found this muster-roll, with other
valuable papers, in an old tea-chest in the attic
of a colonial house at Littleton, Mass., now owned
by a collateral descendant of Capt. Bulkeley. In this
house Major Robert Rogers and his officers once spent
the night, while the privates were quartered in the church near by.</p>
<p>Captain Bulkeley served first in Phineas Osgood’s
Company in their expedition to Nova Scotia, and later
in Robert Rogers’s Rangers. He was killed by the Indians
near Rogers Rock, on Lake George, on March 13, 1758, and forty-seven of his men with him.</p>

<p class="pn center">MAJOR ROBERT ROGERS<br/>
1731-1795</p>
<p>Robert Rogers was the son of James and Mary McFatridge Rogers. He was born in Methuen, Massachusetts, on November 7, 1731. Early in the spring of 1739 James Rogers, with his family, moved from Methuen, to the wilderness of the township now known as Dunbarton, New Hampshire. He named the rich green meadowland and upland, 2190 acres, where he settled, “Munterloney,” for a place where he had once lived in Ireland, a mountainous district in Counties Derry and Tyrone.</p>
<p>Robert thus speaks of the years passed here in “Mountalona”:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It would perhaps gratify the curious to have a particular account of my life, preceding the war; but though I could easily indulge them herein, without any dishonour to myself, yet I beg they will be content with my relating only such circumstances and occurrences as led me to a knowledge of many parts of the country, and tended in some measure to qualify me for the service I have since been employed in. Such, in particular, was the situation of the place in which I received my early education, a frontier town in the province of New Hampshire, where, I could hardly avoid obtaining some knowledge of the manners, customs, and language of the Indians, as many of them resided in the neighborhood and daily conversed and dealt with the English.</p>
<p>“Between the years 1743 and 1755 my manner of life was such as led me to a general acquaintance both with the British and French settlements in North America, and especially with the uncultivated desart, the mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes and several passes that lay between and contiguous to the said settlements. Nor did I con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>tent myself with the accounts received from Indians or the information of hunters but travelled over large tracts of the country myself, which tended not more to gratify my curiosity, than to inure me to hardships, and, without vanity, I may say, to qualify me for the very service I have since been employed in.”</p>
<p class="pn center">—Rogers’ Journals, Introduction. Dublin, 1769.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Robert Rogers was six feet in height, a well-formed, fine looking man,
with fine manners and magnetic presence. He was one of the most athletic
men of his time, well known in all trials of strength or skill. General
Stark used to say of him, that for presence of mind in time of danger, he was unsurpassed.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-three years he organized and disciplined his
Rangers. On the 6th of April, 1758, Captain Rogers was promoted to a
Majority and had command of this famous corps.</p>
<p>His Journals of his Ranging Service, present an interesting
account of his severe and perilous warfare. It is very rare. A copy
recently brought £25. Some of the principal causes of the war are
exhibited with spirit and truth in his drama Ponteach. His Concise
Account of North America and his Concise Historical Account, etc.,
are both rare books containing valuable information.</p>
<p>He died in London, on May 18, 1795.</p>
<p>I claim, and with a justifiable pride, that Robert Rogers, the
famous partisan chief, was the greatest American in the “Old French and Indian War.”</p>
<p>Major Rogers was an author as well as a soldier. After the close
of the “Seven Years’ War,” he went to London and published four books, viz.:</p>

bombarder Carillon et s’y sont présenté plusieurs fois.
Le S<sup>r</sup> d’Hebencourt, Capitaine au régiment de
la Reine qui y a été établi commandant après la Campagne,
et la garnison out été très alerte, les courses des Anglais
ont toujours été infructueuses et le Sieur d’Hebencourt
instruit qu’ils avaient en campagne un parti de 200 hommes,
profita le 13 mars de l’heureuse circonstance de 200 Iroquois
ou Nepissingues du Sault St. Louis et du Lac des Deux Montagnes
arrivés la veille avec le Sr. Durantaye et plusieurs cadets
de la Colonie, le Sieur de Langry Officer très intelligent,
quelques Lieutenans et Sergens de nos bataillons que le zèle
seul y fit marcher s’y joignirent. Le détachement Anglais
composé des soldats d’élite et de 12 officers, commandé par
le Major Roger leur meilleur partisan a été totalement défait
les Sauvages ont rapporté 146 chevelures, peu de prisonniers,
seulement quelques uns pour donner des <i>lettres vivantes</i>
à leur père, expression dont les Sauvages nomment les prisonniers.
Le reste aura péri de misère dans les bois. Quelques uns, entr’eux
deux officiers du Régiment de <i>Blekins</i> se sont rendus d’eux mêmes
prisonniers à notre fort de Carillon au bout de cinq jours leur
guide ayant expiré la veille.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Nous avons perdu à cette action huit sauvages
et nous avons eu 17 blessés ainsi que deux cadets
de la colonie et un canadien. On a couvert les morts
avec grande cérémonie. On a fait des présens au nom du
Roy aux families. Le Gouverneur général recompensera
la bravoure de nos Iroquois par une promotion et donnant
quelques haussecols et médailles à ceux qui se sont distingués,
ils en seront plus animés à venger la perte qu’ils out fait.</p>

<p class="pn mf center">ANECDOTES</p>
<p>When Major Robert Rogers narrated his wonderful story to
the officers in the Coffee House in London, he gave “Munterloney”
as his home, which they supposed to be in Italy, and, knowing
him to be an American, made the story still more improbable.
Gathered in little groups about the tables, one night, these
men were engaged in witty and pleasant discourse, when it was
agreed that the person who should tell the greatest lie, or the
most improbable story, should have his bill paid by the Company.
After all the others had told their stories, Rogers was called upon.
He said: “When a boy in ‘Munterloney’ he made birch and hazel brooms,
which he carried on his back through the woods, guided by spotted
trees, to Rumford, the nearest settlement, a distance of ten miles,
and sold them. He told how his father, dressed in fur, was shot dead
in the wilderness by a hunter, who mistook him for a bear.
He also related that his mother was followed several miles
by a hunter who thought her track in the fresh, light snow,
was that of a wolf. Rogers’ bill was paid by the Company
for it was agreed that the Major had told the greatest <i>lie</i>,
when, in fact, he had only told the <i>truth</i>. This incident
was greatly appreciated by the Major’s family and admirers
in America. Major Rogers went to England in 1765 and, while
travelling in a mail-coach over Hounslow Heath, the coach
was stopped by a highway robber, who presented a pistol at
the window and demanded the passenger’s money. The Major
played asleep, while the other passengers passed over their
money. When it came his turn, he drowsily opened his cloak,
as if about to comply. The robber lowered his pistol.
At the psychological moment, the noted Indian fighter
seized him by the collar, dragged him from his horse
through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
window of the coach, and held him prisoner while he ordered the
terrified coachman to drive on to the authorities. There the Major
delivered him. The prisoner proved to be a celebrated offender for
whose head a reward of £50 sterling had been offered. The famous
Rogers received the bounty.</p>
<hr class="chap"/>
<p class="pn center c13">London, October 8.</p>
<p class="c13">Tuesday last, about two o’clock,
after Major Rogers had passed through Dartford,
the post-chaise man who drove him, told him a highwayman
hovered round the chaise. As soon as the fellow came to the
Major, he seized him by the hand and pulled him into the
chaise. The highwayman answers the description in an advertisement
of Sir John Fielding’s. The Major carried him to the Mayor at
Gravesend, and after an examination there, sent him to
the Ratation-office, in Bow street.</p>

<p>From “The Veil Removed,” John Fellows, New York, 1843, pp. 20 and 21.</p>
<p>That no doubt may rest on the mind of the reader in regard to the
authenticity of the statements of facts by Major Rogers in his journal,
the following testimony of his title to credibility has been obtained
from the distinguished gentlemen therein named, citizens of his native
state, where his character would doubtless be duly estimated:</p>

<p class="pn">“My dear Sir—</p>
<p>“I have this moment read Mr. Coffin’s letter addressed to you,
requesting information in relation to the character of the late
Maj. Robert Rogers. Having recently had occasion to make inquiries
relative to his early history,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I find nothing in the region of his birth that goes at all to discredit
him. One of the last of his blood relations in this vicinity who
personally remembered him, a lady, died about one year ago. From her
mouth, through Mark Burnham, Esq., a native of the same town with
Rogers, I derived the information that all the family were proud of
his name, and were reluctant to associate it with a reputation that
was not entirely unsullied. Maj. Rogers never resided in this state
permanently after the commencement of the Revolutionary War: he was in
the British service in Canada after the close of the old French War,
partly in a military, and partly in a civil capacity. The only child
bearing his name was several years under my care as guardian: this
circumstance, among others, has led me more particularly to mark the
character of the celebrated warrior. I consider him to have been one of
the most talented men of the country—perhaps the best partisan officer
this country ever produced. I believe him to have been the author of
that perfect mode of attack and defence which enabled a hundred of the
rangers to do more service than thousands of the British regulars,
especially in the winter service of the old war of 1756. Such safety
to troops on fatigue amid the severest seasons of a severe climate was
never secured—such certainty in the results, either on the advance
or retreat, perhaps, was never realized by any other force than the
rangers, under the perfect arrangement and discipline invented by
Rogers. I consider him to have been as great a man in his peculiar
sphere as Napoleon Bonaparte, and of moral courage and honesty coming
nearly if not quite up to the mark of Andrew Jackson.</p>

<p>ROGERS’ CONCISE ACCOUNT (From The Gentleman’s Magazine for December, 1765, Vol. 35, pages 584-5.)</p>
<p>This is an account very different from the compilations which are
undertaken for booksellers, by persons wholly unacquainted with the
subject, and who generally have neither sufficient diligence nor skill
to regulate the multifarious materials which lie scattered before them,
perhaps in an hundred volumes, nor even to reject, much less reconcile
the inconsistencies and contradictions with which such materials always
abound.</p>
<p>Major <i>Rogers</i> has travelled through great part of the country he
has described, in the course of his duty as an officer in his majesty’s
army, and has received accounts of other parts immediately from the
inhabitants, or from persons who had been carried prisoners thither,
and afterwards released.</p>
<p>The work is concise and yet full; and the knowledge it contains is
acquired with pleasure, and retained with ease, by the regularity of
the method, and perspicuity of the stile.</p>
<p>The author gives an account of every province separately, and of
its first discovery and settlement; he describes its situation as to
latitude and longitude, and to the countries and seas by which it
is bounded; its extent; its rivers; its climate; its commodities,
buildings, and number of inhabitants: With a particular attention
to such facts and circumstances as appeared most interesting in a
political or commercial view.</p>
<p>In this work there is also an account of the interior part of
<i>America</i>, a territory much larger than the whole continent of
<i>Europe</i>, and hitherto almost wholly
unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> This territory he has considered under
three several divisions, marked out by three great rivers that rise
near the center of it, <i>St. Lawrence</i>, the <i>Christino</i>, and the
<i>Mississippi</i>.</p>
<p>The river <i>St. Lawrence</i> he has traced, and is pretty well
acquainted with the country adjacent to it, as far up as lake
<i>Superior</i>; and with the country from the <i>Green Bay</i> westward, to
the <i>Mississippi</i> at the Gulph of <i>Mexico</i>: He has also travelled
the country adjacent to the <i>Ohio</i>, and its principal branches; and
that between the <i>Ohio</i> and the lakes <i>Erie</i> and <i>Meshigan</i>, and
the countries of the Southern <i>Indians</i>; and his situation gave him
opportunities of gaining accounts of the other parts, more particular
and authentic than any other.</p>
<p>He has subjoined such an account of the <i>Indians</i>, their customs and
manners, as gives a just idea of the genius and policy of the people,
and of the method in which they are to be treated by those who wish to
preserve a safe and advantageous commerce with them. This is a very
entertaining as well as useful part of the work, for which the Major
was particularly qualified, by a long and experimental acquaintance
with their several tribes and nations, both in peace and war.</p>
<p>It is proposed to continue this History in a second volume,
containing maps of the colonies and the interior country, in which the
faults and deficiencies of those already extant will be corrected and
supplied; by subscription; the price one guinea.</p>
<p>(Some extracts from this work shall be occasionally given in the
future numbers of this miscellany.)</p>

most material circumstances of every campaign on that continent, from
the commencement to the conclusion of the war. From the specimen of
the work now before us, it appears that the accounts of Major Rogers
may be depended upon by the public; they are undoubtedly as authentic
as they are important and necessary to those who would acquire a
thorough understanding of the nature and progress of the late military
operations in North America.</p>
<p>The author writes like an honest, a sensible, and a modest man;
and has given, throughout his whole account, undoubted proofs that
he is a brave and skillful officer. He headed, with much reputation,
the provincial troops called rangers, during the whole course of what
were called the French wars in America.—Bibliotheca Americana Nova, or

</div>
<p>Few of our Readers, we apprehend, are unacquainted with the name,
or ignorant of the exploits, of Major Rogers; who, with so much
reputation, headed the provincial troops called Rangers, during the
whole course of our late successful wars in America. To this brave,
active, judicious officer, it is, that the public are obliged for
the most satisfactory account we have ever yet been favoured with,
of the interior parts of that immense continent which victory hath
so lately added to the British empire.——For, as to what Charlevoix,
and other French writers, have related, experience hath shewn with
what artful fallacy their accounts have been drawn up:—with the
obvious design of concealing, from other nations, the true situation,
and real circumstances of that country, of which we were, in many
respects, totally ignorant, till the British lion, in revenge of
repeated insults, tore away the veil, and opened to our view, the wide,
extended, glorious prospect!</p>
<p>The present publication, however, as may be supposed, from the
quantity and price above specified, contains but a part of the
Major’s intended work; the remainder being proposed to be printed by
subscription; and to be illustrated with maps of the several colonies,
and of the interior country of North America. These we are assured, in
the Author’s advertisement, will be ‘more correct, and easier to be
understood, than any yet published.’</p>
<p>Our Author was, happily for his country, the better qualified
not only for the task he hath now enjoined his pen, but also for
the atchievements in which his sword hath been employed, by the
circumstance of his having received his ‘early education in a frontier
town in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
province of New Hampshire, where he could hardly avoid obtaining
some knowlege of the manners, customs, and language of the Indians,
as many of them resided in the neighbourhood, and daily conversed
with the English.—Between the years 1743 and 1755, his manner of
life<a id="FNanchor_5_5"/><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor pginternal">[5]</a> was such, as led him to a general acquaintance
both with the British and French settlements in North America, and
especially with the uncultivated desart, the mountains, valleys,
rivers, lakes, and several passes that lay between and contiguous to
the said settlements. Nor did he content himself with the accounts he
received from the Indians, or the information of hunters, but travelled
over large tracts of the country himself; which tended not more to
gratify curiosity, than to inure him to hardship.——And <i>hardships</i><a
id="FNanchor_6_6"/><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor pginternal">[6]</a>
enough he was destined to endure!</p>
<p>The accounts here given of the British colonies are very brief.
They seem to have been chiefly intended to form an introduction to
the Major’s description of our late conquests in that part of the
world; and which must, undoubtedly, be considered as the most valuable
part of his work. Accordingly he himself observes, that ‘it will
not be expected, after volumes on volumes that have been published
concerning the British colonies on the eastern shore of the American
continent, that any thing materially <i>new</i> can be related of them.’
The only thing, adds he, ‘that I mean to attempt with regard to this
is, to collect such facts and circumstances, as in a political and
commercial view, appear to me to be most interesting; to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>reduce them to an easy
and familiar method, and contract them within such narrow limits, that
the whole may be seen as it were at once, and every thing material be
collected from a few pages, concerning seventeen provinces; a minute
and circumstantial account of which would fill so many considerable
volumes.</p>
<p>‘In doing this, where my own knowlege (acquired by travelling
several times through most of them) did not serve me, I have
endeavoured to make use of the most authentic materials, collected from
others, and to set every fact and circumstance in a true and impartial
light, without favour or prejudice to any particular part or party.</p>
<p>‘But the principal object I have had in view, and what I look upon
to be the most interesting and deserving part of this work, is the
account I have given of the interior parts of North America, which
though concise, and vastly short of what I should be glad to exhibit,
I flatter myself is as full and perfect as any at present to be come
at. Certain I am, that no one man besides has traveled over and seen so
much of this part of the country as I have done; and if my remarks and
observations relative thereto are injudicious or wrongly placed, it is
not owing to any want of attention to the subject, but merely to a want
of skill. What is comprehended under the appellation of the <i>interior</i>
country of America, is of itself a larger territory than all the
continent of Europe, and is at present mostly a desart, uninhabited,
except by savages: it cannot therefore be reasonably expected that
any one man has it in his power to give a just and minute account of
its several parts, but that he must pass over large tracts of country
in very general terms, and in many things depend upon the reports of
others, or proceed upon his own uncertain conjectures.</p>
<p>‘This wide-extended country may naturally enough be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
considered under three general divisions, occasioned by the three
great rivers that take their rise near the center of it, namely, St.
Lawrence, the Christino, and the Mississipi. The first of these I have
traced, and am pretty well acquainted with the country adjacent to it
as far up as Lake Superior, and with the country from the Green Bay
westward to the Mississipi, and from thence down to the mouth of the
Mississipi at the gulph of Mexico. I have also travelled the country
adjacent to the Ohio and its principal branches, and that between
the Ohio and the Lakes Erie and Meshigan, and the countries of the
southern Indians. But as to the country above Lake Superior, I have
my intelligence chiefly from Indians, or from prisoners that have
travelled with them into it. The same is the case as to the country at
the head of the Mississipi, and that adjacent to the river Misauris.
The Christino I have taken wholly from the Indians: and though the
accounts they have given me of these countries are large, and in some
particulars very inviting, yet I shall do little more than mention
their names, till I have better authority to go upon.</p>
<p>‘In the account I have subjoined of the Indians, their customs,
manners, &amp;c. I have purposely omitted many things related by others
who have wrote on that subject: some, because they are false, and
others, because they are trite and trifling; and have only mentioned
such as I thought most distinguishing and absolutely necessary to give
a just idea of the genius and policy of that people, and of the method
in which they are to be treated, in order to our having any safe and
advantageous commerce with them. And, without vanity, I may say, that
the long and particular acquaintance I have had with several tribes
and nations, both in peace and war, has at least furnished me with
materials to treat the subject with propriety.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
As we have had many contradictory accounts of the two Floridas, part
of our newly acquired territories; and as many of our Readers may be at
a loss what idea to form of those settlements, we shall present them
with Major Rogers’s account of them entire: which will likewise serve
as a specimen of his brief way of mentioning the elder Colonies, most
of which he has described with nearly the same brevity.</p>
<p>‘The country south of Georgia, and between that and the Mississippi
river, an extent of about 600 miles, was by the Spaniards called
Florida, which name it still retains; but is now divided by the English
into two provinces, viz. East and West Florida.</p>
<p>‘East Florida is bounded north by Georgia, or St. John’s river,
which divides them; eastwardly and southwardly, by the gulph of
Florida; south-west, by West Florida; and north-west, by the country of
the Creek Indians.</p>
<p>‘The Spaniards attempted a settlement at St. Augustine in this
province in 1512; however they were obliged to abandon this attempt,
by reason of the savages, and other inconveniences, they not being
properly supplied with necessaries to go through with it. In 1565 they
again took possession, and erected a fort called St. Augustine, which
commanded a convenient harbour for their ships trading between Spain
and America; but there being a constant war between the Spaniards and
Creek Indians, greatly prevented the enlarging their settlements here.
They maintained their garrison (though several attempts were made to
reduce it by the Carolinians, and afterwards by General Oglethorpe)
till the conclusion of the late war, when the garrison and the whole
territory of Florida was ceded to the crown of Great Britain, by the
treaty of Fountainbleau, in 1762. His Britannic Majesty
being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> absolute sovereign
of the soil, has the appointment of the governors in both of the
Floridas.</p>
<p>‘The soil of East Florida is not so good as that of Georgia in
general; but the northerly part of it adjacent to Georgia is much like
it, and may be improved to all the purposes that Georgia is, viz. for
raising of corn, rice, indigo, silk, wine, &amp;c. and again, in the
west part of the province is some very good land, capable of being
improved to great advantage.</p>
<p>‘The centre or Cape of Florida is a more sandy soil; however, there
are some good settlements begun in this province, under the direction
of Colonel Grant, the present Governor of it, and there is a prospect
of it soon becoming a flourishing province; and as inhabitants are
flocking to it from several countries in Europe, there is no doubt but
in a short time it will be considerable.</p>
<p>‘Their exports at present are but small, the produce of their trade
with the Indians being the chief they have to spare. As the country
was three years since almost entirely uncultivated, and the number of
inhabitants as yet but small, no great improvements and productions are
at present to be expected; but, undoubtedly, this country is capable of
producing rice, indigo, silk, wine, oil, and other valuable commodities
in great abundance. As the country is new, it has great plenty of
all kinds of wild game, common to the climate. The metropolis of the
province is St. Augustine. The number of inhabitants, exclusive of his
majesty’s troops garrisoned there, is, as I am told, about 2000.</p>
<p>‘It may well be supposed, from its southerly situation, that the air
and climate of this province is not more agreeable and healthy than
that of Georgia, and that it is no less infested with poisonous and
troublesome animals of various shapes and sizes.’—Thus far, relating to
<i>East-Florida</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
‘West Florida was seized upon by the French, who began a settlement
in it at Pensacola, in 1720, and they enjoyed it till the before
mentioned treaty of Fountainbleau in 1762, when this was ceded to and
formed into a government by his Britannic majesty. It is bounded,
eastwardly, by East Florida; southwardly, by the Gulph of Mexico;
westwardly, by the Mississipi river, and the Lake St. Pier; and
northwardly, by the country of the Chikitaws.</p>
<p>‘The principal town is Pensacola; and as many of the French, who
inhabited here before the treaty, have chose to become British subjects
for the sake of keeping their estates, this will contribute to the
speedy peopling this province, and no doubt render the settlements
considerable very soon, especially as the land in this province is
mostly very good, vastly preferable to the eastern province, its soil
being capable of producing all the valuable commodities of rice,
indigo, wine, oil, &amp;c. in the greatest abundance; and its situation
for trade is extremely good, having the river Mississipi for its
western boundary.</p>
<p>‘They already carry on a very considerable trade with the Indians,
and export great quantities of deer-skins and furs. The French
inhabitants here raise considerable quantities of rice, and build some
vessels.</p>
<p>‘There are at present, as I am told, about 6000 inhabitants in
this province, which increase very fast, it being much more healthy
and inviting than East Florida; especially the western parts upon the
banks of the Mississipi, where it is said to be agreeable enough to
English constitutions. In short, it is not to be doubted but that in a
few years this will be a rich and flourishing province, nature having
denied it nothing that is necessary to make it so.’</p>
<p>How far our Author’s account of these two
settlements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
may, in every circumstance, be depended upon, is a point not perfectly
clear to us, as we are not precisely informed whether he hath related
all of them from his own personal acquaintance with those provinces;
or whether he hath not chiefly made his report from the information of
others. He appears, however, to be so honest a Writer, that we do not
suspect him to be capable of any <i>intention</i> to mislead his Readers, in
any respect whatever.</p>
<p>In our Author’s description of the manners and customs of the
Indians, particularly those called the <span class="smcap">Five
Nations</span>, are many curious particulars; some of which may serve
as a proper supplement to the account extracted, in the preceding
article, from Lieutenant Timberlake’s Memoirs: and the observations
of both these writers may, perhaps, be considered by the judicious
Readers as a valuable addition to the more elaborate performance<a id="FNanchor_7_7"/><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor pginternal">[7]</a> of Cadwallader Colden Esq.; published not long
before the commencement of our Review.</p>
<p>These <i>Five Nations</i>, are, beyond all the other Indian tribes, the
most distinguished for their understanding, their valour, and above
all, for their glorious spirit of liberty: in which respect even
Britons may be proud to call them <i>their brethren</i>. Of these, again,
the Mohawks are the first in rank, (in regard to the aforementioned
virtues) though at present the smallest in number: to which
circumstance they have been reduced, from being the most numerous,
by their continual wars. The union of the five nations, somewhat
resembles that of the Dutch United Provinces; and this republican
league, or confederacy, in which no one nation hath any superiority
over the other, have subsisted so long, that the
Europeans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> says Mr. Colden, know
nothing of its origin. Their most northern settlement, says Mr. Rogers,
‘is a town called Chockonawago, on the south of the river St. Lawrence,
opposite to Montreal; but their largest settlements are between Lake
Ontario and the provinces of New York and Pensylvania, or the heads of
the Mohock, Tanesee, Oneoida and Onondaga rivers. They claim all the
country south of the river St. Lawrence to the Ohio, and down the Ohio
to the Wabach, from the mouth of the Wabach to the bounds of Virginia;
westerly, to the Lakes Ontario and Erie, and the river Miamee; their
eastern boundaries are lake Champlain, and the British colonies. When
the English first settled in America, they could raise 15,000 fighting
men; but now, including the Delawares and Shawanees, they do not amount
to more than between three or four thousand, having been thus reduced
by the incessant wars they have maintained with the other Indians, and
with the French, in Canada.’</p>
<p>Speaking of the great military exploits of the Mohawks, our
Author assures us, that they have been inveterate enemies to the
French, ever since their first settlement in Canada; that they once
burned the city of Montreal; and that they are almost the only
Indians within many hundred miles, that have been proof against the
solicitations of the French to turn against us; but the greatest
part of them have maintained their integrity, and been our stedfast
friends and faithful allies.—As to their persons, Mr. Rogers remarks,
that there is rarely found, among the Indians, a person that is any
way ‘deformed, or that is deprived of any sense, or decrepid in any
limb, notwithstanding the little care taken about the mother in the
time of her pregnancy, the neglect the infant is treated with when
born, and the fatigues the youth is obliged to suffer; yet generally
they are of a hale, robust, and firm
con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>stitution; but spirituous liquors, of
which they are insatiably fond, and the women as well as the men,
have already surprizingly lessened their numbers, and will, in all
probability, in one century more nearly clear the country of them.’</p>
<p>How greatly have these untutored people the advantage over
us, in respect to what is observed, in the beginning of this
last quotation! To what can it be owing that, <i>among us</i>, <span
class="smcap">SO MANY</span> are found deformed, or deprived of
one or other of their senses? To what more than the spirit of
Quackery<a id="FNanchor_8_8"/><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor pginternal">[8]</a> which, for many ages past, hath taken possession
of us, instead of the simplicity of former times? Quackery seems,
indeed, to have vitiated our whole National Constitution and character:
it hath infected our government, our religion, our laws, nay our very
nurseries! Every thing appears to be <i>over-done</i>, among us; and,
(anxious mortals that we are) we act as though afraid of trusting to
Providence, or leaving any thing to the unerring direction of nature.
Hence, each succeeding generation is continually busied in undoing
what was done by their predecessors: hence the perpetual changes
and revolutions of all our systems; and, hence, perhaps, the fatal
necessity for so many repeals of the solemn acts and decrees even of
senatorial wisdom!—But to our Author.</p>
<p>Among other virtues possessed by the Indians, Mr. Rogers extols
their surprizing patience and equanimity of mind. They have, says
he, a ‘command of every passion, except revenge, beyond what
philosophers or Christians usually attain to. You may see them bearing
the most sudden and unexpected misfortunes with a calmness and
composure of mind, without a word, or change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> of countenance; even a prisoner, who knows
not where his captivity may end, or whether he may not in a few hours
be put to a most cruel death, never loses a moment’s sleep on this
account, and eats and drinks with as much chearfulness as those into
whose hands he has fallen.</p>
<p>‘Their resolution and courage under sickness and pain is truly
surprising. A young woman will be in labour a whole day without
uttering one groan or cry; should she betray such a weakness, they
would immediately say, that she was unworthy to be a mother, and that
her offspring could not fail of being cowards. Nothing is more common
than to see persons, young and old of both sexes, supporting themselves
with such constancy under the greatest pains and calamities, that even
when under those shocking tortures which prisoners are frequently
put to, they will not only make themselves chearful, but provoke and
irritate their tormentors with most cutting reproaches.’</p>
<p>Their method of declaring war is very solemn, and attended, says our
Author ‘With many ceremonies of terror.’ In the first place, they call
an Assembly of the Sachems [old men] and warriors to deliberate on the
affair; in which congress the women have a voice as well as the men.
Take our Author’s farther account in his own words.</p>
<p>‘When they are assembled, the president or chief Sachem proposes
the affair they have met to consult upon, and, taking up the hatchet
(which lies by him) says, who among you will go and fight against
such a nation? Who among you will go and bring captives from thence,
to replace our deceased friends, that our wrongs may be avenged, and
our name and honour maintained as long as rivers flow, grass grows,
or the sun and moon endure? He having thus said, one of the principal
warriors rises, and harangues the whole assembly; and
then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> addresses himself
to the young men, and inquires, who among them will go along with
him and fight their enemies? when they generally rise, one after
another, and fall in behind him, while he walks round the circle or
parade, till he is joined by a sufficient number. Generally at such
a congress they have a deer or some beast roasted whole; and each
of them, as they consent to go to war, cuts off a piece and eats,
saying, This way will I devour our enemies, naming the nation they
are going to attack. All that chuse, having performed this ceremony,
and thereby solemnly engaged to behave with fidelity and as a good
warrior, the dance begins, and they sing the war-song; the matter of
which relates to their intended expedition and conquest, or to their
own skill, courage and dexterity in fighting, and to the manner in
which they will vanquish and extirpate their enemies; all which is
expressed in the strongest and most pathetic manner, and with a tone
of terror. So great is the eloquence or influence of their women in
these consultations, that the final result very much depends upon
them. If any one of these nations, in conjunction with the chiefs,
has a mind to excite one, who does not immediately depend upon them,
to take part in the war, either to appease the manes of her husband,
son, or near relation, or to take prisoners, to supply the place of
such as have died in her family, or are in captivity, she presents,
by the hands of some trusty young warrior, a string of wampum to the
person whose help she solicits; which invitation seldom fails of its
desired effect. And when they solicit the alliance, offensive or
defensive, of a whole nation, they send an embassy with a large belt
of wampum, and a bloody hatchet, inviting them to come and drink the
blood of their enemies. The wampum made use of upon these and other
occasions, before their acquaintance with the Europeans, was nothing
but small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> shells,
which they picked up by the sea-coasts and on the banks of the lakes;
and now it is nothing but a kind of cylindrical beads, made of shells
white and black, which are esteemed among them as silver and gold are
among us. The black they call the most valuable, and both together are
their greatest riches and ornaments; these, among them answering all
the ends that money does among us. They have the art of stringing,
twisting, and interweaving these into their belts, collars, blankets,
mogasons, &amp;c. in ten thousand different sizes, forms and figures,
so as to be ornaments for every part of dress, and expressive to them
of all their important transactions. They die the wampum of various
colours and shades, and mix and dispose them with great ingenuity
and order and so as to be significant among themselves of almost any
thing they please; so that by these their records are kept, and their
thoughts communicated to one another, as ours are by writing. The belts
that pass from one nation to another, in all treaties, declarations,
and important transactions, are carefully preserved in the palaces
or cabbins of their Chiefs, and serve, not only as a kind of record
or history, but as a public treasure. It must, however, be an affair
of national importance in which they use collars or belts, it being
looked upon as a very great abuse and absurdity to use them on trifling
occasions. Nor is the calumet or pipe of peace of less importance, or
less revered among them in many transactions, relative both to war and
peace. The bowl of this pipe is made of a kind of soft red stone, which
is easily wrought and hollowed out; the stem is of cane, elder, or some
kind of light wood, painted with different colours, and decorated with
the heads, tails, and feathers of the most beautiful birds, &amp;c.
The use of the calumet is, to smoak either tobacco, or some bark-leaf,
or herb, which they often use instead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> it, when they enter into an alliance,
or on any serious occasion, or solemn engagements; this being among
them the most sacred oath that can be taken, the violation of which is
esteemed most infamous, and deserving of severe punishment from heaven.
When they treat of war, the whole pipe and all its ornaments are red;
sometimes it is red only on one side, and by the disposition of the
feathers, &amp;c. one acquainted with their customs will know, at first
sight, what the nation who presents it intends or desires. Smoaking the
calumet is also a religious ceremony upon some occasions, and in all
treaties is considered as a witness between the parties; or rather as
an instrument by which they invoke the sun and moon to witness their
sincerity, and to be, as it were, guarantees of the treaty between
them. This custom of the Indians, though to appearance somewhat
ridiculous, is not without its reasons; for, they finding smoaking
tended to disperse the vapours of the brain, to raise the spirits and
qualify them for thinking and judging properly, introduced it into
their counsels, where, after their resolves, the pipe was considered as
a seal of their decrees, and, as a pledge of their performance thereof,
it was sent to those they were consulting an alliance or treaty with:
so that smoaking among them in the same pipe is equivalent to our
drinking together, and out of the same cup.’</p>
<p>Here we cannot help observing what a noble and consistent spirit
of liberty prevails among these Indians, with respect to the method
used by their chiefs of <i>inviting</i>, not <i>impressing</i>, the people
to accompany them to the wars. What a striking contrast does this
afford, to our tyrannical practice of <i>seizing</i> our fellow-subjects
by brutal force, <i>imprisoning</i> and <i>transporting</i> them like felons
and Newgate convicts; and, after such base treatment, compelling
them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> to go
forth with our fleets and armies, to fight in defence of the <span
class="smcap">RIGHTS</span> and <span class="smcap">LIBERTIES</span> of
their country!</p>
<p>In short, says our Author, the great and fundamental principles ‘of
their policy are, that every man is naturally free and independent;
that no one or more on earth has any right to deprive him of his
freedom and independancy, and that nothing can be a compensation for
the loss of it.’</p>
<p>Describing the other Indian nations, still farther to the westward,
viz. those bordering on the great lakes, Mr. Rogers hath introduced
some account of the famous Pondiac, or <i>Ponteack</i>, according to our
Author. ‘The Indians on the lakes,’ says he, ‘are generally at peace
with one another, having a wide extended and fruitful country in their
possession. They are formed into a sort of empire, and the emperor is
elected from the eldest tribe, which is the Ottawawas, some of whom
inhabit near our fort at Detroit, but are mostly further westward
towards the Mississipi. Ponteack is their present King or Emperor, who
has certainly the largest empire and greatest authority of any Indian
chief that has appeared on the continent since our acquaintance with
it. He puts on an air of majesty and princely grandeur, and is greatly
honoured and revered by his subjects. He not long since formed a design
of uniting all the Indian nations together under his authority, but
miscarried in the attempt.</p>
<p>‘In the year 1760, when I commanded and marched the first detachment
into this country that was ever sent there by the English, I was met in
my way by an embassy from him, of some of his warriors, and some of the
chiefs of the tribes that are under him; the purport of which was, to
let me know, that Ponteack was at a small distance, coming peaceably,
and that he desired me to halt my detachment till such time as he could
see me with his own eyes. His ambassadors had also orders to inform
me, that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Ponteack, the King and Lord of the country I was in.</p>
<p>‘At first salutation when we met, he demanded my business into his
country, and how it happened that I dared to enter it without his
leave? When I informed him that it was not with any design against
the Indians that I came, but to remove the French out of his country,
who had been an obstacle in our way to mutual peace and commerce, and
acquainted him with my instructions for that purpose. I at the same
time delivered him several friendly messages, or belts of wampum,
which he received, but gave me no other answer, than that he stood in
the path I travelled in till next morning, giving me a small string
of wampum, as much as to say, I must not march further without his
leave. When he departed for the night, he enquired whether I wanted
any thing that his country afforded, and he would send his warrior to
fetch it? I assured him that any provisions they brought should be paid
for; and the next day we were supplied by them with several bags of
parched corn, and some other necessaries. At our second meeting he gave
me the pipe of peace, and both of us by turns smoaked with it; and he
assured me he had made peace with me and my detachment; that I might
pass through his country unmolested, and relieve the French garrison;
and that he would protect me and my party from any insults that might
be offered or intended by the Indians; and, as an earnest of his
friendship, he sent 100 warriors to protect and assist us in driving
100 fat cattle, which we had brought for the use of the detachment from
Pittsburg, by the way of Presque Isle. He likewise sent to the several
Indian towns on the south-side and west-end of lake Erie, to inform
them that I had his consent to come into the country. He attended me
constantly after this interview till I arrived at Detroit, and while I
remained in the country, and was the means
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> preserving the detachment from the fury
of the Indians, who had assembled at the mouth of the strait with an
intent to cut us off.</p>
<p>‘I had several conferences with him, in which he discovered great
strength of judgment, and a thirst after knowledge. He endeavoured
to inform himself of our military order and discipline. He often
intimated to me, that he could be content to reign in his country in
subordination to the King of Great Britain, and was willing to pay him
such annual acknowledgment as he was able in furs, and to call him his
uncle. He was curious to know our methods of manufacturing cloth, iron,
&amp;c. and expressed a great desire to see England, and offered me a
part of his country if I would conduct him there. He assured me, that
he was inclined to live peaceably with the English while they used him
as he deserved, and to encourage their settling in his country; but
intimated, that, if they treated him with neglect, he should shut up
the way, and exclude them from it; in short, his whole conversation
sufficiently indicated that he was far from considering himself as a
conquered Prince, and that he expected to be treated with the respect
and honour due to a King or Emperor, by all who came into his country,
or treated with him.</p>
<p>‘In 1763, this Indian had the art and address to draw a number of
tribes into a confederacy, with a design first to reduce the English
forts upon the lakes, and then make a peace to his mind, by which he
intended to establish himself in his imperial authority; and so wisely
were his measures taken, that, in fifteen days time, he reduced or took
ten of our garrisons, which were all we had in his country, except
Detroit; and had he carried this garrison also, nothing was in the
way to complete his scheme. Some of the Indians left him, and by his
consent made a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
separate peace; but he would not be active or personally concerned in
it, saying, that when he made a peace, it should be such an one as
would be useful and honourable to himself, and to the King of Great
Britain: but he has not as yet proposed his terms.</p>
<p>‘In 1763, when I went to throw provisions into the garrison at
Detroit, I sent this Indian a bottle of brandy by a Frenchman. His
counsellors advised him not to taste it, insinuating that it was
poisoned, and sent with a design to kill him; but Ponteack, with a
nobleness of mind, laughed at their suspicions, saying it was not in my
power to kill him, who had so lately saved my life.</p>
<p>‘In the late war of his, he appointed a commissary, and began
to make money, or bills of credit, which he hath since punctually
redeemed. His money was the figure of what he wanted in exchange for
it, drawn upon bark, and the shape of an otter (his arms) drawn under
it. Were proper measures taken, this Indian might be rendered very
serviceable to the British trade and settlements in this country, more
extensively so than any one that hath ever been in alliance with us on
the continent.</p>
<p>‘As our Readers are, perhaps, by this time, fully satisfied with
regard to these free-born sons of the vast American wilderness, we
shall conclude the present article, with a remark or two, borrowed
from Mr. Colden, in respect to the Five nations. ‘They are called,
says he, a barbarous people, bred under the darkest ignorance; and yet
a bright and noble genius shines through these black clouds. None of
the Roman heroes have discovered a greater love to their country, or a
greater contempt of death, than these people called <i>barbarians</i> have
done, when liberty came in competition. Indeed I think,’ continues
that learned and sensible historian, ‘our Indians have out-done the
Romans in this particular. Some of the greatest of those have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> murdered themselves to
avoid shame or torments; but the Indians have refused to die meanly,
or with but little pain, when they thought their country’s honour
would be at stake by it; but have given their bodies, willingly, to
the most cruel torments of their enemies, to shew, as they said, that
the Five Nations consisted of men whose courage and resolution could
not be shaken.—They greatly sully, however, these noble virtues, by
that cruel passion, <i>revenge</i>; this, they think, is not only lawful,
but honourable; and for this only it is that they can deserve the name
of barbarians.—But what, alas! have we <i>Christians</i> done, to make them
<i>better</i>? We have, indeed, reason to be ashamed that these infidels,
by our conversation and neighbourhood, are become <i>worse</i> than they
were before they knew us. Instead of virtues, we have only taught them
vices, which they were entirely free from before that time.’ In another
place he observes, on the same subject, that this cruelty of revenge,
is not peculiar to the Five Nations, but is common to all the other
Indians. To blunt, however, the keenness of that censure <i>we</i> might
be apt to cast on them, upon this account, he hath the following just
reflection: ‘It is wonderful, how custom and education are able to
soften the most horrid actions, even among a polite and learned people.
Witness the Carthaginians and Phoenicians burning their own children
alive in sacrifice; and several passages in the Jewish history;—and
witness, in later times, the Christians burning one another for God’s
sake!’</p>

<p>JOURNALS OF MAJOR ROBERT ROGERS (From The Monthly Review; or,

<p class="outdent">Art. 32. <i>Journals of Major Robert Rogers;
containing an Account of the several Excursions he made, under the
Generals who commanded on the Continent of America, during the late
War.</i></p>
<p class="outdent"><i>From which may be collected the most material
Circumstances of every Campaign on that Continent, from the
Commencement to the Conclusion of the War.</i> 8vo. 4s. Millan.</p>
</div>
<p>This is but the first part of the journals of this noted American
partizan. It commences in 1755, and terminates with the year 1760. The
second part, which is to be printed by subscription of one guinea,
will contain the Author’s travels among the Cherokees and the southern
Indians; his second tour into the interior country, upon the great
lakes; and the Indian wars in America, since 1760: together with
correct plans of all the British forts upon the continent.</p>
<p>From the specimen of the work now before us, it appears, that the
accounts published by Major Rogers may be depended upon by the public;
they are undoubtedly as authentic as they are important and necessary,
to those who would acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and
progress of the late military operations in North-America. The Author
writes like an honest, a sensible, and a modest man; and he has given,
throughout his whole conduct, undoubted proofs, that he is a brave
and a skilful officer. For a farther idea of this gentleman, in his
literary capacity, see our review of his <i>Account of North America</i>, in
the preceding part of our No. for the present month.</p>
